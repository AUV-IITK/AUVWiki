# HOW TO BUILD THE REPO
In order to run the code ,we have to first build it .

## Here are the steps to build the repo
1. Make a new workspace named catkin_ws(it should be specifically catkin_ws otherwise it will give an error).
2. Put the whole __auv__ repo in the src directory.
3. Then ```$cd ~/catkin_ws```
3. Source it ```$source devel/setup.bash```
4. Then type ```$./src/auv/utils/build.sh```
5. If it is  giving an error then try again sourcing it.
6. If you get lucky, then the repo will be built in one go.
